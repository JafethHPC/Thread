Okay, I've revamped the chatbot's interface to make the replies much easier to read and visually appealing, aligning with the minimalist and contextual design you're aiming for with "Thread".

Here's a breakdown of what I did:

1.  **Structured AI Responses**: I've moved away from displaying plain text AI replies. Now, the internal system can recognize whether the bot's response is a simple text message, an email summary, or a list of tasks.

2.  **Created Dedicated UI Components**:

    - **Email Cards**: When the chatbot provides an email summary, it's now displayed in a clean, organized card. This card shows the sender, subject, and a snippet of the email body, with a quick link to reply.
    - **Task Lists**: For task-related queries, you'll no longer see a jumbled line of text. Each task is now listed individually with its title, status (e.g., "In Progress"), due date, and a direct link to open the task in Google Tasks.

3.  **Dynamic Conversation View**: The main conversation area now dynamically adjusts to the type of information being displayed, using the new card and list components when needed. This makes the entire interaction feel more intelligent and context-aware.

4.  **Parsing Logic**: I've added logic that can take the old, string-based responses and parse them into the new structured format. This ensures that even if the backend hasn't been updated yet, the frontend can still present the information in the new, cleaner UI.

The development server is running, so you can open the application in your browser to see the new UI in action.

This new setup not only improves the user experience but also lays a solid foundation for future enhancements, like adding more types of contextual information or making the components more interactive.

Let me know what you think of the new design!
